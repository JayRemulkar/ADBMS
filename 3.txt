#temporal data:
A temporal database stores data relating to time instances. 
It offers temporal data types and stores information relating to past, present and future time. 
Temporal databases could be uni-temporal, bi-temporal or tri-temporal.

More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid time, transaction time or decision time.

Valid time is the time period during which a fact is true in the real world.
Transaction time is the time at which a fact was recorded in the database.
Decision time is the time at which the decision was made about the fact.
