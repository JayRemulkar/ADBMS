#Spatial Data:
Spatial data is associated with geographic locations such as cities,towns etc. 
A spatial database is optimized to store and query data representing objects. 
These are the objects which are defined in a geometric space.

#Characteristics of Spatial Database
A spatial database system has the following characteristics

It is a database system
It offers spatial data types (SDTs) in its data model and query language.
It supports spatial data types in its implementation, providing at least spatial indexing and efficient algorithms for spatial join.
Example
A road map is a visualization of geographic information. 
A road map is a 2-dimensional object which contains points, lines, 
and polygons that can represent cities, roads, and political boundaries such as states or provinces. 

In general, spatial data can be of two types âˆ’

Vector data: This data is represented as discrete points, lines and polygons
Rastor data: This data is represented as a matrix of square cells.


The spatial data in the form of points, lines, polygons etc. is used by many different databases as shown above.
