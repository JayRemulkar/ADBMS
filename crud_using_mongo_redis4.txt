MongoDB:
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL 
database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by 
MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server-Side Public License (SSPL) which is deemed non-free by several 
distributions.

Redis:
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and 
message broker, with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, 
lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, Hyper Loglogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices. The project was developed and 
maintained by Salvatore Sanfilippo, starting in 2009. From 2015 until 2020, he led a project core team sponsored 
by Redis Labs. Salvatore Sanfilippo left Redis as the maintainer in 2020. It is open-source software released under 
a BSD 3-clause license. In 2021, not long after the original author and main maintainer left, Redis Labs dropped 
the Labs from its name and now is known simply as "Redis".

to query a collection for a document.
