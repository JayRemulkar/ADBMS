HBase:
HBase is an open-source non-relational distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java. It 
is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop 
Distributed File System) or Alluxio, providing Bigtable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a faulttolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data (small amounts of information caught within a large 
collection of empty or unimportant data, such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records or 
finding the non-zero items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection).

Apache Cassandra:
Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system 
designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no 
single point of failure. Cassandra offers support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous 
masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients. Cassandra was designed to implement a 
combination of Amazon's Dynamo distributed storage and replication techniques combined with Google's Bigtable 
data and storage engine model.

Create Operation:
The create or insert operations are used to insert or add new documents in the collection. If a collection does not 
exist, then it will create a new collection in the database.

Read Operation:
The Read operations are used to retrieve documents from the collection, or in other words, read operations are used 
to query a collection for a document.

Update Operation:
The update operations are used to update or modify the existing document in the collection. 

Delete Operation:
The delete operation is used to delete or remove documents from a collection.
