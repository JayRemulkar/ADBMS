MySQL Database:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", 
the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the acronym for Structured Query 
Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each 
other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmer used to create, modify and extract data 
from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and 
SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's 
storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of 
backups.
